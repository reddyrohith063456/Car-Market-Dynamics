## What This Project Is About

This project focuses on understanding the key factors that influence car prices. Using a dataset of used cars (including brand, fuel type, age, and more), the goal was to visualize patterns and answer questions like:

- Which car brands hold the most value?  
- How do fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven impact price?  
- What’s the relationship between car age and its selling price?

A Tableau dashboard was created to make these insights easy to explore and interpret.
